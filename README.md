# Teddy's Developer Blog

Hi, this is my dev blog. I create monthly blog posts about C# and .NET on there. 
It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and generated via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using my theme [jekyll-theme-teddy](https://github.com/Teddy55Codes/jekyll-theme-teddy).
