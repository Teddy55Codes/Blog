This is my developer blog where i write about different topics depending on what i am hyper focusing on that month.
It usually follows a monthly cycle, but sometimes there are smaller extra posts.

The posts mostly cover topics related to .NET and C#.

Currently most of the content for these posts comes from my monthly apprenticeship journals.
